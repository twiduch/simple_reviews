When I get a Review, I want it to be vetted based on the following rules.

* Offensive words
  - We don't want any offensive words so avoid the following:
    - Elderberry,
    - Hamster,
    - PHP,
    - Brainfuck
  - Note: The list might change if we discover any other offensive words!
* Repetition
  - Repetition is often an indication of a fake review, if words are repeated three or more times 
    in a row it is a fake review.
* Prices
  - We do not want anyone mentioning prices in their reviews, it causes problems 
    between different retailers.
